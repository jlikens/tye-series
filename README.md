# tye-series
A code series that shows practical, real-world scenarios involving distributed applications and Project Tye.  In general, each example builds upon the ideas of th previous one, but each is also designed to run on its own.

## The Story
This series started life as the demo code for a dev talk.  The first six parts are centered around a simplified journey from a simple monolith to a microservice architecture, using a contrived set of business rules to make things a little complicated.

## Pre-requisites 
The basics:
* Install [.NET 5.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)
* Install [Project Tye](https://github.com/dotnet/tye)

For examples that use containers:
* Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) for your OS
