# tye-talk-2020-05-tye-ahoy
If you made it this far: CONGRATULATIONS!!  We're finally going to do something with Tye!  If you will recall, we left off in our [previous example](../tye-talk-2020-04-intertwined) with several co-dependent applications: a front-end web app and three microservices.  We made the choice to tie a bunch of these together to illustrate how easy it is for microservice development to become difficult when it comes to your local dev environment.
